## Config

- VIDEO_PATHS: Paths of video files that will be imported - subfolders will be searched recursively
- IMAGE_PATHS: Paths of image files that will be imported - subfolders will be searched recursively
- SCAN_ON_STARTUP: Whether video and image paths should be scanned
- SCAN_INTERVAL: Rescan paths all X milliseconds - only works when SCAN_ON_STARTUP is enabled
- LIBRARY_PATH: Path where the library (.db files & uploaded files & processed images) will be stored (default: working directory)
- FFMPEG_PATH: Where the ffmpeg binary is located; will be placed in working directory when downloading using the setup
- FFPROBE_PATH: Where the ffprobe binary is located; will be placed in working directory when downloading using the setup
- GENERATE_THUMBNAILS: Whether thumbnails should be extracted from imported videos
- GENERATE_MULTIPLE_THUMBNAILS: Generate single or multiple thumbnails. If true, THUMBNAIL_INTERVAL will determine how many thumbnails are generated
- GENERATE_PREVIEWS: Whether video preview should be generated from imported videos (used in video player)
- THUMBNAIL_INTERVAL: Seconds between thumbnail snapshots in seconds
- PORT: Port server is running on
- APPLY_ACTOR_LABELS: Whether actor labels should be applied to scenes and images the actor is starring in
  - Example: Kali Roses has labels "blonde" & "tattoos". Importing a new video featuring Kali Roses (will be matched if "Kali Roses" is in the video title or path), the newly created scene will automatically inherit "blonde" & "tattoos" + other labels that have been extracted from the title or path.
- APPLY_STUDIO_LABELS: Same as APPLY_ACTOR_LABELS, but for studios
- READ_IMAGES_ON_IMPORT: Read image dimensions/hash on import, will greatly increase import time for a big image library (10000+)
- REMOVE_DANGLING_FILE_REFERENCES: Remove scenes/images from the database that can not be found on disk
- BACKUP_ON_STARTUP: Whether to create a backup when starting the server
- MAX_BACKUP_AMOUNT: Max amount of backups in backups/ folder. Oldest one will be deleted, if max amount has been reached.
- EXCLUDE_FILES: Array of regular expressions that, if any of them match a file name, will cause the file to be ignored
- CALCULATE_FILE_CHECKSUM: Generate file checksum (hash) on import (decreases import speed)
